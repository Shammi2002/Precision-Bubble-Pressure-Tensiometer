# Precision-Bubble-Pressure-Tensiometer
EE322 Embedded System Design Project - Group 11

The measurement of surface tension is a fundamental requirement across a diverse range of scientific and industrial disciplines, from optimizing pharmaceutical drug delivery systems to ensuring the stability of formulations in the chemical and food industries. Inaccurate monitoring of this property can lead to significant operational challenges, including reduced product shelf life, malfunctioning diagnostic devices, and environmental inefficiencies.

To address these challenges, this project presents the design and implementation of a Precision Surface Tension Instrument based on the Maximum Bubble Pressure Method. Developed as part of the EE322 Embedded Systems module, the system leverages the ATmega328P microcontroller to provide an automated, high-precision alternative to traditional manual measurement techniques.

By integrating real-time data acquisition from pressure and depth sensors with low-level software optimization in Assembly language, the instrument achieves high processing efficiency and reliability. The solution is specifically engineered to meet the needs of research laboratories and quality control environments, offering a sophisticated yet cost-effective tool for liquid property analysis and process optimization.
